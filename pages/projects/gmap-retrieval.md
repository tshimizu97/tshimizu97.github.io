gmap-retrieval is a Python package I developed as a part of my work at <span style="color: blue; ">[Genetic Epidemiology Lab of Andrea Ganna, PhD](https://www.dsgelab.org/)</span>.

This package consists of multiple wrapper functions, which internally calls Google APIs, and allows users easily retrieve pre-processed geographical data such as Google Street View images, satellite images and place data from Google Map. This API was developed for the purpose of collecting geographical data of individuals in biobank datasets in research contexts.

Programming languages and tools used in this project include: **Python, Google Cloud Console, Google API**
